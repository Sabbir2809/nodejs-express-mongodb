# Backend: Node.js Express.js MongoDB

## [Chapter-1: Introduction to Node, NPM, Package.json](https://github.com/Sabbir2809/nodejs-express-mongodb/tree/chapter-1)

- **Node JS** installation from official site nodejs.org - use only LTS versions
- Use **terminal / command prompt** to check installation :
  `node -v`
  `npm -v`
  `nodemon -v`
- **VS Code** installation directly from code.visualstudio.com site
- Use VS code terminal to run **commands**
- **Node REPL** interface can be used directly by typing `node` in **terminal / command prompt** . Use **Ctrl+D** to exit interface. Use **CTRL+C** to exit terminal
- Running any JavaScript file from node using `node filename.js`
- **Modules** are basic containers in Node/JavaScript system. 1 file can be one module in Javascript.
- Two type of Module Systems in node JS are - **CommonJS** module and **ES** Modules.

**1. CommonJS Module:**

```javascript
//lib.js
exports.sum = function () {};

//index.js
const module = require('./lib.js');
module.sum();
```

**2. ES Module:**

```javascript
//lib.js
export { sum };

//index.js
import { sum } from './lib.js';
```

- FileSystem Module(fs) is one of core modules of Node JS. **fs** can be used to read/write any file. There are many more core modules in NodeJS which you can check in NodeJS API docs.
- Reading files can be **Synchronous** or **Asynchronous**. **Async** is most preferred method in NodeJS. As there is **NO blocking of I/O in NodeJS**

- Node project can be initialized with `npm init` command which also creates `package.json` file
- **package.json** is a configuration file for node projects which has **scripts**, **dependencies**, **devDependencies** etc
- `npm install <package-name>` is used to install any online modules available for node on NPM repository online.
- `nodemon` is a package for running node server and track live changes to re-start again.
- `scripts` inside **package.json** can be used like `npm run <script-name>` e.g `npm run dev`. Only for `npm start` you can avoid `run`.
- use `npm install -g <package.json>` to install packages globally on your system. Not just in the project but useful all over your system.
- Node versions are formatted like **4.1.9** where these are `major.minor.patch` versions.
- you can install all dependencies again using `npm install` again
- **package-lock.json** has exact versions installed and link of dependencies of each package.
- use `npm update` to update packages safely. `npm outdated` shows outdated and latest versions of packages installed in your **package.json**
- use `npm uninstall <package-name>` to uninstall packages from `package.json`
- `node_modules` should not be shared - you can make `.gitignore`to ignore them to be uploaded.

## [Chapter-2: Server Concepts with Node - http module](https://github.com/Sabbir2809/nodejs-express-mongodb/tree/chapter-2)

#### HTTP requests

Request object comprises of many properties, but important ones are :

- **Type of Request** : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.
- **Headers** : Meta data sent by your browser like browser name, cookies, authentication information etc.
- **Query Parameters** (url?`name=john`) : This is used in GET requests to send data to server
- **Route Params** (url/`john`)
- **Body data** : This is used in POST and other requests to send data to server

#### HTTP responses

Response object comprises of many properties, but important ones are :

- **Headers** : Meta data sent by your server back to client like server name, content size, last updated time etc.
- **Response status code** (`200`, `404`, `403`, `502`)
- **Response body** : Actual data to be sent to client : HTML, JS, JSON, CSS, Image etc.

#### More info

- HTTP requests and responses can be tracked from **Dev Tools** > **Network Tab**
- In Node, we can use core **http** module to create a Server which listens to requests, modify data in-between and provides responses. Server needs a **PORT** to be bound to - use only port number > 1024.
- Server can simply be said as **a function which receives a request and returns a response**. [ This is just for understanding]
- There are many **Headers** which exists on request and responses - shared a link below with list of existing headers.

- We can use Server to do 3 things:

  - **Static file Hosting** : Sending normal files without formatting or modifying.
  - **Server Side Rendering** : Mixing data with templates and rendering dynamic views (dynamic web pages)
  - **Web APIs** : Sending data via some APIs/ endpoints.

- Every Request has one and only one response. If there is more than 1 response which you want to send - you will encounter a error - "_Headers already sent_"
- POSTMAN is a software for doing complex API requests.

## [Chapter 3 - Express JS](https://github.com/Sabbir2809/nodejs-express-mongodb/tree/chapter-3)

- **ExpressJS** is _de-facto_ Node framework - and used in most Node applications which are used as web server.
- You can install express `npm install express`
- Express has few level of methods :

  - Application methods : e.g. app.use()
  - Request methods
  - Response methods
  - Middleware methods
  - Router methods

- **Response** methods (**res** is our response objects)
  - **res.send()** - for sending HTML
  - **res.sendFile(**) - for sending File
  - **res.json** - for sending JSON
  - **res.sendStatus(404)** - for sending HTTP status only
- **HTTP Request** Types we generally use :
  - GET
  - POST
  - PUT
  - DELETE
  - PATCH
- API / Endpoints / Routes are used inter-changeably but they are related to server paths.

- **Middle-ware** : Modifies the request before it reaches the next middleware or endpoints.
- Sequence of middleware is very important, as first middleware is first traversed by request.
- Middle-wares can be used for many use cases, like loggers, authentication, parsing data etc.
- Middle-ware can be :

  - Application level : server.use(**middleware**)
  - Router level : server.get('/', **middleware**, (req,res)=>{})
  - Built-in middleware : **express.json()** [ for parsing body data], **express.static()**[for static hosting]
  - External Middle-wares - like **morgan**

- **Request** properties (**req** is our request object)

  - **req.ip** - IP address of client
  - **req.method** - HTTP method of request
  - **req.hostname** - like google.com / localhost
  - **req.query** - for capturing query parameters from URL e.g. localhost:8080 ? **query=value**
  - **req.body** -for capturing request body data (but its needs a middleware for body data decoding)
  - **req.params** - for capturing URL parameters for route path like `/products/:id`

- **Static Hosting** : we can make 1 or more folders as static hosted using **express.static** middleware.
  `server.use(express.static(< directory >))`
  Static hosting is like sharing a folder/directory and making its file readable as it is.
  Note : `index.html` is default file which would be read in a static hosted folder, if you don't mention any file name.

3 major ways of sending data from client to server via request are :

**1. Send data via URL in Query String**

This is easiest method to send data and mostly used in GET request.

When you have URL with `?name=Youstart&subject=express` at end, it translates in a query string. In query string each key,value pair is separated by `=` and between 2 such pairs we put `&`.

To read such data in express you can use `req.query` :

```javascript
server.get('/demo', function (req, res) {
  console.log(req.query); // prints all data in request object
  res.send(req.query); // send back same data in response object
});
```

**2. Send data via Request Params**

In this method you can have a URL with url path like `/Youstart/express` at end it translates in a param string. In param part string each value is separated by `/`. As you can see that URL only contains `value` not the `key` part of data. `key` part is decided by the endpoint definition at express server

```javascript
server.get('/demo/:name/:subject', function (req, res) {
  console.log(req.params); // prints all data in request object
  res.send(req.query); // send back same data in response object
});
```

So sequence of values matter in this case. As values sent from client are matched with `name` and `subject` params of URL later.

**3. Send data via Request Body**

Final method of sending data is via body part of request. We can send data directly to body using URL. We have to either use one of these methods

1.  Use a HTML Form and make `method` value as `POST`. This will make all name=value pair to go via body of request.
2.  Use special browsers like POSTMAN to change the body directly. (We will see this example in next classes)

```js
server.post('/demo', function (req, res) {
  console.log(req.body); // prints all data in request object
  res.send(req.body); // send back same data in response object
});
```
